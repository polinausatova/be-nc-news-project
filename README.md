# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Access to the necessary environment variables

For anyone who wishes to clone this project and run it locally: you will need to create `.env` files with the environment variables in order to successfully connect to the two databases for development and test data.

Please contact me on **Slack Polina Usatova** for further instructions.

## Dependencies

Please use `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
